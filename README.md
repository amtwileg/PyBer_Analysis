# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of the new analysis is to compare fares by city type, riders, and drivers.

## Results
![x](analysis/Pyber_fare_summary_df.png)

It can be seen from the summary dataframe above that:
1. Urban type receives the most rides / drivers / total fares (then suburban, then rural)
2. Average fare per ride and driver is largest in rural, then suburban, then urban
3. Rural and suburban have more rides than drivers, whereas urban has the opposite relationship

It can be seen from the multiple-line chart that:
1. Total fare is fairly stable by type over time

## Summary
I recommend the following three items for addressing disparity among the city types:
1. Urban has the lowest fare per ride / driver. Increase the average fare per ride so drivers make similar money.
2. Rural does not have enough drivers, so increase advertising in rural areas to increase number of drivers / riders.
3. Cross-subsidize rides between types - using rural / suburban profits to subsidize urban, effectively lowering fares for riders and increasing fares for drivers in urban areas, should help balance out the differential between rides and drivers
